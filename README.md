## What's BEAR.Sunday

This resource orientated framework has both externally and internally
 a **REST centric architecture**,  implementing **Dependency Injection** and
**Aspect Orientated Programming** heavily to offer you surprising
simplicity,  order and flexibility in your application. With very
 few components of its own, it is a fantastic example of how a framework
 can be built using  existing components and libraries from other
frameworks, yet offer even further benefit and beauty.

## Everything is a resource

In BEAR.Sunday **everything is a REST resource** which leads to far simpler design and extensibility.
Interactions with your database, services and even pages and sections of your app all sit comfortably in a resource which can be consumed or rendered at will.

## GET - Hello World

The resource class receive a named argument over the query parameters of the URL.
![Halo](http://koriym.github.io/BEAR.Sunday/images/screen/url.png)

```php
class Hello extends Page
{
    public function onGet($name = "World")
    {
        $this['greeting'] = "Hello " . $name;
        return $this;
    }
}
```
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <body>
        {$greeting}
    </body>
</html>
```

## Application Script

Application execution sequence is scripted by the user-defined application script.

```php


// Here we get the application instance.
$app = (new Injector(new SundayModule))->getInstance(AppInterface::class);
/** @var $app AbstractApp */

// Calling the match of a BEAR.Sunday compatible router will give us the $method, $path, $query to be used in the page request.
$request = $app->router->match($GLOBALS);
try {
    // resource request
    $page = $app->resource
        ->{$request->method}
        ->uri($request->path)
        ->withQuery($request->query)
        ->request();
    /** @var $page Request */

    // representation transfer
    $page()->transfer($app->responder);

} catch (\Exception $e) {
    $code = $e->getCode() ?: 500;
    http_response_code($code);
    echo $code;
    error_log($e);
}
```

## Application Object
Application is just stored in [one object variable](http://bearsunday.github.io/readme/print_o/app.html).
You can access all resource of application with resources clients, easy use from plain PHP files or CMS and other frameworks as well.

```php
<?php

$app = require 'MyApp/scripts/instance.php';
$hello = $app
->resource
->get
->uri('app://self/hello')
->withQuery(['name' => 'Pull world !'])
->eager
->request();

?>
<html>
<body>
greeting: <?php echo $hello['greeting']; ?>
time: <?php echo $hello['time']; ?>
</body>
</html>
```

Dependency injection
--------------------
It is google guice style DI framework.

### Binding
```php
$this->bind(Annotations::class)
     ->to(FileCacheReader::class)
     ->in(Scope::SINGLETON);
```

### Consumer

```php

public function __construct(Annotations $reader)
{
    $this->reader = $reader;
}
```

## Aspect oriented programming
Many features of the framework are implemented as an aspect.

### Interceptor

```php
class WeekendBlocker implements MethodInterceptor
{
    public function invoke(MethodInvocation $invocation)
    {
        $today = getdate();
        if ($today['weekday'][0] === 'S') {
            throw new \RuntimeException(
                  $invocation->getMethod()->getName() . " is not allowed on weekends!"
            );
        }
        return $invocation->proceed();
    }
}
```
### Service

```php
class RealBillingService implements BillingService
{
    /**
     * @WeekendBlock
     */
    public function chargeOrder()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```
### Weaving an Interceptor
```php
$this->bindInterceptor(
    $this->matcher->any(),
    $this->matcher->annotatedWith('WeekendBlock'),
    [WeekendBlocker::class]
);
```

## RESTful Service

Resource object fusion resources and web PHP class.

### Resource object
```php
class Greetings extends AbstractObject
{
    public function onGet($lang = 'en')
    {
        $this['greeting'] = $this->message[$lang];
        return $this;
    }
}
```
### Resource client

```php
use ResourceInject;

$this->resource->get->uri('app://self/greetings')->withQuery(['lang' => 'ja'])->eager->request();
```
